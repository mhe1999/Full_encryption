# secure communication over the insecure channel  
try to make a secure channel between client and server(socket) with cryptographic mechanisms to guarantee the integrity and confidentiality of exchanged messages over the insecure communication channel.
using Diffie-Hellman algorythm for key exchange and AES for encryption and hash to make sure of integrity of messages

## Getting Started
The program use some pyDH for Diffie-Hellman algorythm and pycryptodome for encryption

### Prerequisites

then install pycrypto and pyDH:
```
pip install pycryptodome
pip install pyDH
```
